Scenarios for a Climate-Neutral Energy System: Choose Your Path to 2050

## Hero Section (Introduction)
The choices we make today will shape our energy landscape for generations. As the Netherlands commits to climate neutrality by 2050, we stand at a crossroads. Which path will we take?

TNO has developed two comprehensive scenarios that illuminate possible futures for our energy system. These aren't just technical roadmaps – they're visions of how we'll live, work, and thrive in a sustainable Netherlands.

## Main Content

### The Challenge We Face
Every sector – from heavy industry to your daily commute – must transform. But how quickly? How boldly? And at what cost? Our scenarios provide clear answers to guide policymakers, businesses, and citizens.

### Two Paths to Climate Neutrality

## Accordion Blocks Section

### [Accordion Block 1] ADAPT: The Pragmatic Path
**Summary:** Building on today's proven technologies with steady, incremental progress.

**Content:**
In the ADAPT scenario, we take a measured approach to change:

- **55% emission reduction by 2030** through optimization of existing systems
- **Focus on proven technologies** like wind, solar, and current battery solutions
- **Gradual industrial transformation** allowing businesses time to adjust
- **Lower initial investments** but potentially higher long-term costs

**What this means for you:**
- **Citizens:** Steady energy prices, familiar technologies, gradual lifestyle adjustments
- **Businesses:** Time to adapt business models, lower upfront costs, predictable transitions
- **Policymakers:** Manageable implementation, broad public acceptance, reduced disruption

**Key technologies:** Offshore wind expansion, solar panel deployment, battery storage, green hydrogen for industry

### [Accordion Block 2] TRANSFORM: The Ambitious Leap
**Summary:** Embracing breakthrough innovations for rapid, comprehensive change.

**Content:**
The TRANSFORM scenario envisions bold action and innovation:

- **65%+ emission reduction by 2030** through aggressive transformation
- **Early adoption of emerging technologies** including advanced storage and carbon capture
- **Rapid industrial revolution** positioning Netherlands as a green technology leader
- **Higher initial investments** yielding greater long-term benefits

**What this means for you:**
- **Citizens:** Initial disruption followed by lower energy costs, cutting-edge solutions, cleaner environment sooner
- **Businesses:** First-mover advantages, new market opportunities, innovation leadership
- **Policymakers:** Ambitious targets met, international leadership, long-term economic benefits

**Key technologies:** Next-generation batteries, green hydrogen economy, carbon capture and utilization, circular material flows

### [Accordion Block 3] Critical Differences That Matter
**Summary:** Understanding the key distinctions between scenarios helps stakeholders make informed choices.

**Content:**
**Energy Independence:**
- ADAPT: 70% energy independence by 2050
- TRANSFORM: 85% energy independence by 2050

**Economic Impact:**
- ADAPT: €150-200 billion total investment
- TRANSFORM: €250-300 billion total investment with faster ROI

**Innovation Timeline:**
- ADAPT: Proven technologies deployed 2025-2035, innovations 2035-2050
- TRANSFORM: Parallel deployment of current and emerging technologies from 2025

**Circular Economy:**
- ADAPT: 50% renewable-based chemicals by 2050
- TRANSFORM: 90% renewable-based chemicals by 2050

### [Accordion Block 4] What Success Looks Like
**Summary:** Visualizing the outcomes helps stakeholders understand the real-world impact.

**Content:**
**In 2050 under ADAPT:**
- Stable, affordable energy from familiar renewable sources
- Gradual transformation of industrial processes
- Balanced approach between economic and environmental goals
- Netherlands as reliable green energy partner

**In 2050 under TRANSFORM:**
- Energy abundance from diverse innovative sources
- Netherlands as global hub for green technology
- Circular economy fully realized
- Leading position in sustainable innovation

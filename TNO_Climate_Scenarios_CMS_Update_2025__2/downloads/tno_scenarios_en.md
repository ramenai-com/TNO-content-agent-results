# Scenarios for a Climate-Neutral Energy System

## Overview
The goal is to achieve a climate-neutral energy system by 2050. The European Commission and government have tightened 2030 targets, requiring greenhouse gas emissions to reduce by at least 55%.

## Energy Policy Recommendations
TNO provides insights for:
- National government policymakers
- Energy companies
- Industry
- Trade associations
- Technology developers

## Future Energy Supply Scenarios

### Two Scenarios

#### 1. ADAPT
- Builds on current economic strength
- Maintains current lifestyle
- Less ambitious sustainability approach

#### 2. TRANSFORM
- Focuses on behavioral change
- Deploys innovative technologies
- More ambitious sustainability targets

## Key Scenario Differences

### Energy Demand and Production
- TRANSFORM has lower energy demand
- New industrial processes for chemicals and fuels
- Aims for self-sufficiency in renewable energy

### Carbon and Emissions
- ADAPT: CO2 capture from fossil sources
- TRANSFORM: Reuse biogenic CO2
- Targets 90% high-value chemicals from renewable carbon by 2050

## Nuclear Power Considerations
- Potential additional carbon-free energy source
- Should not overshadow solar and wind ambitions
- Might be necessary if solar/wind insufficient

## Key Insights
- More ambitious climate policy does not necessarily increase costs
- Renewable energy becoming increasingly cost-effective
- Requires integrated approach across disciplines

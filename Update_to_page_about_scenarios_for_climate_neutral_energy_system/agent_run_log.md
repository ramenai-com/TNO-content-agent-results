**Date**: 2025-06-17
**Task ID**: Row 7398723649671044 from Sheet 6650717281406852
**Status**: Backlog
**Priority**: High
**Due Date**: 2025-06-27

### Task Description
The task involves rewriting content for TNO website pages about scenarios for climate neutral energy system to improve storytelling coherence. The pages exist in both English and Dutch:
- English: https://www.tno.nl/en/sustainable/system-solutions-environment/transition-pathways/scenarios-climate-neutral-energy-system/
- Dutch: https://www.tno.nl/nl/duurzaam/systeemoplossingen-omgeving-milieu/transitiepaden/scenario-klimaatneutraal-energiesysteem/

Suggestion to use accordion blocks for better content organization.

### Actions Taken

1. **Created directories**:
   - ./downloads - for storing any attachments
   - ./results - for final output files

2. **Retrieved task from Smartsheet**:
   - No attachments found for this task
   - Found 2 discussions with 7 comments total (test discussions, not relevant to task)

3. **Downloaded TNO web pages**:
   - English version: https://www.tno.nl/en/sustainable/system-solutions-environment/transition-pathways/scenarios-climate-neutral-energy-system/
   - Dutch version: https://www.tno.nl/nl/duurzaam/systeemoplossingen-omgeving-milieu/transitiepaden/scenario-klimaatneutraal-energiesysteem/

4. **Content extraction and analysis**:
   - Created Python script to extract main content from HTML
   - Converted HTML to Markdown using pandoc
   - Extracted 45 sections from English version
   - Extracted 53 sections from Dutch version

5. **Content analysis findings**:

   - Information is presented in a fragmented way
   - Key concepts (ADAPT and TRANSFORM scenarios) are not introduced clearly upfront
   - Technical details are mixed with policy recommendations
   - The story doesn't build progressively from problem to solution

6. **Creating improved content**:
   - Restructuring content with accordion blocks for better organization
   - Creating a coherent narrative flow from challenge to solution
   - Grouping related content thematically
   - Making the two scenarios (ADAPT and TRANSFORM) central to the story

7. **Deliverables created**:
   - English improved content: `/results/tno_scenarios_english_improved.md`
   - Dutch improved content: `/results/tno_scenarios_dutch_improved.md`
   - CMS implementation instructions: `/results/CMS_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Summary of Improvements

The rewritten content provides:
- **Better storytelling**: Clear narrative from problem to solution
- **8 Accordion blocks** for organized, scannable content
- **Clear scenario comparison**: ADAPT vs TRANSFORM clearly explained
- **Action-oriented conclusions**: Specific next steps for stakeholders
- **Improved user experience**: Users can explore topics of interest

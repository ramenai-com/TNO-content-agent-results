<h1 id="how-draghi-steers-the-new-european-commission">How Draghi Steers
the New European Commission</h1>
<p>In early September, the impressive report “<a
href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/strengthening-european-competitiveness/eu-competitiveness-looking-ahead_en">The
Future of European Competitiveness</a>” by former ECB President and
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi was published. His general analysis
– the EU economy’s innovation capacity and productivity development are
increasingly lagging behind the US and China – was received as a wake-up
call. His main recommendations – such as the need for €800 billion in
additional investments and a new, coordinated industrial policy – made
headlines in all member states. The alarming report was handed over to
Ursula von der Leyen, the current President of the European Commission
(EC), who is running for her second term until 2029. The content of
Draghi’s report is interesting, but more important for its expected
policy impact is that Von der Leyen explicitly instructed her <a
href="https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/towards-new-commission-2024-2029/commissioners-designate-2024-2029_en">new
team of Commissioners</a> to boost European competitiveness a week
later.</p>
<h2 id="three-new-portfolios-within-the-ec">Three New Portfolios within
the EC</h2>
<p>“Draghi” is prominently featured in her mission letters for the next
five years to the Commissioners. There are three new portfolios for the
Executive Vice Presidents, clearly inspired by his ideas. Ribera
Rodríquez becomes Executive Vice President for “Clean, Fair, and
Competitive Transition”; Henna Virkkunen for “Tech Sovereignty,
Security, and Democracy”; and Stéphane Séjourne for “Prosperity and
Industrial Strategy”. While the focus of the EC 2019-2024 was on being
ready for the digital age, an economy that works for people, and
achieving the Green Deal and a climate-neutral continent, the priorities
for 2024-2029 shift to clean tech, competitiveness, sovereignty,
security, and industrial policy.</p>
<h2 id="far-reaching-proposals-for-a-new-economy">Far-reaching Proposals
for a New Economy</h2>
<p>What can we expect from the new European Commission? Reading the
mission letters, we can anticipate several far-reaching proposals.</p>
<p>The EC wants to pursue a more active industrial policy, partly in
response to the Inflation Reduction Act in the US, which attracts
European companies with funds and tax benefits, and the rapidly emerging
conquest of the European market by Chinese companies receiving state
aid. They want a Clean Industrial Deal with adjustments to EU state aid
rules, allowing for more public support to accelerate the energy
transition, decarbonize industry, and ensure sufficient production
capacity for clean tech. A specific task is to lower energy prices in
the EU for businesses, as electricity prices are currently 2 to 3 times
higher than in the US and gas prices 4 to 5 times higher. This price
difference is mainly due to Europe’s scarcer natural resources, but also
due to fundamental shortcomings in the joint energy market, such as
poorly connected energy infrastructure between member states, different
and conflicting national policy regimes, and very limited cross-border
competition between energy companies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the EC will review competition policy for horizontal
mergers – read: merging (inter)national competitors – because there is a
geopolitical need for European companies to operate on a larger scale,
have more investment power and willingness, and thus act more
resiliently, efficiently, and innovatively on the world stage. Draghi
calls these the European champions necessary to compete with American
and Asian giants. Besides this relaxation of competition policy, the EC
wants to strengthen other parts to better support European companies in
scaling up within the EU and beyond, and to more powerfully protect
promising, innovative startups and scaleups against killer acquisitions.
This is a policy shift: EU competition rules will gain new power-forming
and protective functions.</p>
<p>The EC also wants to establish a European Competitiveness Fund (ECF)
<a
href="https://sciencebusiness.net/fp10/commission-prepares-bundle-all-research-and-innovation-money-competitiveness-fund?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Commission%20prepares%20to%20bundle%20all%20research%20and%20innovation%20money%20into%20competitiveness%20fund&amp;utm_campaign=Science%7CBusiness%20Bulletin%20No%20%201229">by
bundling existing funds</a>, to quickly organize financing for Important
Projects of Common Interest (IPCEIs) for the most strategic sectors and
technologies, helped by the relaxed state aid rules. The EU needs to
scale up and protect these projects faster in the geopolitical struggle
with the US and China. European public procurement rules will also be
adjusted to ensure a certain supply of vital technologies, products, and
services, and to ensure that European production in strategic sectors
and technologies continues. Besides this strategic support for domestic
businesses in the internal market, the Commission will more forcefully
and compellingly apply the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR). The FSR,
which came into force last year, gives the EC the ability to tackle
internal market distortions caused by foreign subsidies to companies,
for example by forcing subsidized assets to be sold or giving
competitors access to subsidized infrastructure. This should ensure a
level playing field with foreign companies in the European internal
market, in line with the EC’s proposal earlier this month <a
href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2539575-eu-landen-stemmen-in-met-heffing-op-chinese-elektrische-auto-s">for
higher tariffs on Chinese electric cars</a>.</p>
<h2
id="new-coordinated-european-industrial-strategy-for-innovation">New,
Coordinated European Industrial Strategy for Innovation</h2>
<p>This upcoming EC wants to lead the EU into a modern innovation era
with a new, coordinated industrial strategy. The core of this: member
states must invest more, coordinate, and innovate, and more actively and
powerfully use the opportunities of the joint internal market and
external economic policy. This shift was also seen in the <a
href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ny3j24sm/much-more-than-a-market-report-by-enrico-letta.pdf">Letta
report</a> on the future of the internal market: the belief is that
guaranteeing the four classical freedoms of persons, goods, services,
and capital is no longer sufficient. On Draghi’s recommendation, the
Commission wants to develop a Competitiveness Coordination Tool through
which member states will coordinate investment and policy choices,
focusing on clean tech, decarbonization, and incentivizing investment.
Brussels also wants to conclude an Industrial Decarbonisation
Accelerator Act to create leading markets in the development,
production, and adoption of clean tech in industry, with accelerated
permitting procedures. Additionally, the competitiveness of the defense
industry will be targeted, with improvements to the internal market,
stimulation of innovation, and increased coordinated public and private
investments. The EC will work on a European Defence Union.</p>
<h2 id="extra-focus-on-digital-innovation-in-the-eu">Extra Focus on
Digital Innovation in the EU</h2>
<p>Digital innovation rightly receives much attention and extra policy
focus. The EC will look at how digital technologies and AI opportunities
can be better utilized, which is essential for increasing productivity
in the EU. Brussels wants AI startups and industries to have access to
supercomputing capacity and, together with member states, industry, and
social partners, will develop an Apply AI Strategy to improve the use of
AI in industry and public services. The functioning of the (future)
internal European digital market – like the energy market – must also be
significantly improved to increase competitiveness. The Commission is
therefore aiming for a Digital Networks Act, a European Data Union
Strategy, and an EU Cloud Policy: rules and regulations to harmonize,
simplify, and connect. Finally, European cybersecurity standards must be
raised and harmonized.</p>
<p>As the EU currently lags significantly behind the US in big tech, the
EC primarily wants to increase activities and investments in “emerging”
technologies such as supercomputing, semiconductors (chips), the
Internet of Things, genomics, quantum computing, and space tech. Here,
larger opportunities seem to exist to lead the way in the future,
provided they are coordinated. For example, Brussels is now stimulating
the development of eight large quantum computers, paying half the costs,
<a
href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/nieuws/2024/10/nieuwste-quantumcomputer-komt-in-nederland">with
one to be located in Amsterdam at the national supercomputer
Snellius</a>. For chips, they will analyze where the strategic segments,
innovation potential, and material production opportunities lie, and
there will be an EU long-term plan for quantum chips. The Commission
wants to focus on future technologies, their economic value, and greater
strategic autonomy: much attention will therefore be given to reducing
dependencies on critical raw materials and materials from non-EU
countries. Hence, an EU Critical Raw Materials Platform will be
established. The new EC also wants to launch a Circular Economy Act to
create market demand for secondary raw materials and organize a single
internal European market for waste, which is also necessary to start
reusing critical raw materials and materials.</p>
<h2 id="europe-will-be-built-through-crises">Europe Will Be Built
Through Crises</h2>
<p>It is so clear how Draghi is steering the new European Commission, at
the request of Von der Leyen. The Commissioners seem set to come up with
far-reaching proposals on clean tech, competitiveness, sovereignty,
security, and industrial policy over the next five years.</p>
<p>A point of attention for the Netherlands is that we have more of a
growing high-tech industry – think of companies like ASML, NXP, or VDL,
which make specialized production tools that play increasingly important
roles in international value chains – than a green tech industry.
Indeed, also to produce green tech, but not exclusively. However, the
expanding Dutch high-tech industry has similar problems to the green
tech industry that Draghi focuses on, namely that the raw materials for
production also predominantly come from China, creating dependencies and
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The main omission in the mission letters is: how do we get the money?
That €800 billion in additional investments will not come solely from
the market. While Draghi clearly expresses his support for structural
joint debt issuance by EU member states to finance part of the necessary
public investments in innovation and infrastructure and strengthen the
European capital markets union, this politically sensitive idea
understandably does not return. Ultimately, member states will still
have to repay joint debt issuance, and national political support for
this remains limited. For the Netherlands, it is true that we are
sufficiently creditworthy to attract capital ourselves to achieve the
goal of investing 3% of GDP in R&amp;D – if we really wanted to.
Additionally, we have several private investors such as venture capital,
banks, insurers, and pension funds, but they invest only sparingly in
the Netherlands itself. There is still policy gain to be made here.
Lagging investments are also simply a result of low return expectations,
partly because entrepreneurship, valorization, and productivity
improvement in the EU and the Netherlands received relatively less
attention (or still do) compared to regulating the qualitative effects
of innovation or its application. At the European and national levels,
there is still room for solutions here.</p>
<p>A major uncertainty is, of course, to what extent Germany and France
follow the analysis in the report “The Future of European
Competitiveness” and – above all – to what extent they will support the
new EC’s proposals. While France traditionally – especially under
President Macron – has a more positive attitude towards central
industrial policy and European investments, Germany is opposed to this.
But now that the <a
href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2024/10/11/het-duitse-businessmodel-is-in-groot-gevaar-a4869033">German
economy</a> and <a
href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2538287-nog-geen-concrete-maatregelen-na-overleg-auto-industrie-en-duitse-overheid">automotive
industry</a> are in very difficult times, and Chancellor Scholz has
announced a <a
href="https://nieuws.nl/economie/scholz-nieuw-beleid-nodig-om-duitse-industrie-te-helpen">new
industrial policy</a>, things could change. There are similarities with
2020, when the EC launched the EU recovery fund during the corona
crisis, and France and Germany suddenly turned out to be supporters, to
the great surprise of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“Europe will be built through crises,” predicted Jean Monet, one of
the founders of the EU. This proves true time and again. And Draghi
knows this.</p>
